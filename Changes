Revision history for PAPS-Database-papsdb-Schema

Next
  New features:
    - The referencing_works many-to-many relationship in the Work class now
      includes the same fields from the work_references table that the
      referenced_works relationship includes (commit 4b2f7fd9c2).
    - Added display_name methods for the SourceCategory, SourceCategoryType,
      SourceTag, and SourceTagTypes Result classes.  These, for now, just use
      the name field as the display name.
  Bug fixes:
    - The many-to-many relationship works in the People class referenced an
      incorrect (nonexistent) belongs_to relationship in the Works class
      (commit 4b2f7fd9c2).
    - The has-many relationships from Work to WorkReferences did not reflect
      the correct interpretation for these relationships.  These have been
      switched, so, for example, now the referenced_works relationship gives
      the list of works that that Work object references (commit 4e93443f94).

      sample data.
